# Beginner Projects 🚀

This repository contains small starter projects that I built while learning programming fundamentals.  
Each project is designed to improve problem-solving skills, coding style, and hands-on experience with different technologies.

## Projects Included
- 🎮 Tic Tac Toe (console-based & GUI variations)
- Importance of Hahing algorithm while storing password
- ...and more to come

## Purpose
- Practice coding concepts in a hands-on way
- Strengthen fundamentals (loops, functions, classes, data structures)
- Build a portfolio of small but meaningful projects

## Tech Stack
Projects are implemented using different languages & frameworks to explore:
- C#

⚠️ **Note:** These are practice/starter projects – simple by design, focused on learning rather than production readiness.
